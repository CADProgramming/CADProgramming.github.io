                        <div class="collapseable">This class was an introduction to software engineering and involved a group challenge which helped decide our team members.</div>

                        <h3 class="collapseable">What did you do in the last 30 minutes?</h3>
                        <div class="collapseable">- Looked for a more inspirational team name (Piet)<img src="./img/piet.jpg" alt="" style="width: 50px; padding-left: 25px; vertical-align:middle;"><br><br>I wan't particulary happy with our team name of Bash simply because I don't like Bash. The other members of our team didn't seem to mind changing the team name. I looked into some programming language names and chose Piet, a bitmap based programming language. I suggested the name to the team and they agreed that it would work.<br><br>
                            - Started looking at Laravel tutorials<img src="./img/laravel.png" alt="" style="width: 140px; padding-left: 25px; vertical-align:middle;"><img src="./img/laragon.png" alt="" style="width: 120px; padding-left: 25px; vertical-align:middle;"><br><br>Laravel is a PHP framework that is used for developing a web applications. We are responsible for teaching ourselves how to use Laravel and to make sure we are familiar with it so that we can use it for our project sprints. I spent some of the remaining time watching the first couple of videos.</div>
                        <h3 class="collapseable">What did you learn from this session?</h3>
                        <div class="collapseable">- How to jump into a team (flexibility)<br><br>We were not allowed to choose our team members and so this forced me to interact with people that I am less familiar with and work with them in a team challenge.<br><br>
                            - Helping decide on the approach our group would take towards the research task (12 principles and 4 values)<br><br>I simply suggested that we should split the work load into 3 segments so that we could find the definitions much faster. This ended up working out really well because when we had finished we told eachother what we had learnt and gathered a good understanding of the researched material.<br><br>
                            - Learning about effective ways to produce software in the real world industry<br><br>Learning about the 12 main principles and 4 major values of software engineering helped me get a better idea of how to produce software more effectivley and gave me insight on the importance of developer/client communications when developing software.<br><br>
                            - Getting to know the team members<br><br>Today I met Ian, one of our team members and got an initial idea of how our team members work. Learning about your team members and how they process their work load, especially when they are in a team environmnent, is valuable information.<br><br>
                            - Basic background into laravel and how it communicates with servers to retrieve web applications<br><br>Today I had my first look at PHP and Laravel. I managed to figure out how to use Laragon to create a Laravel application thanks to some help from Faisal. I learnt about the general concepts of how PHP works in the background with regards to Laravel web applications.</div>
                        <h3 class="collapseable">How Does This Relate Back to the 12 Principles?</h3>
                        <div class="collapseable">- Principle 5 "Support, trust, and motivate the people involved"<br><br>I believe that we helped to motivate eachother during the research task by giving our team a direction as to how we were going to find the information. This helped our team to be more effective and produce a good size response in a short period of time.<br><br>
                        - Principle 6 "Enable face-to-face interactions"<br><br>Obviously we were in the same room and in the same area as eachother, enabling face to face communication.<br><br>
                        - Principle 11 "Self-organizing teams encourage great architectures, requirements, and designs"<br><br>Once we had decided on a direction, every member of our team was able to independantly source the information we had allocated for eachother. We didn't have to worry about eachother's progress, creating a bit of trust between the team members. It also demonstrated each team member's motivation and ability to research.<br><br>
                        - Principle 12 "Regular reflections on how to become more effective"<br><br>This reflection in my portfolio will help me to improve my ability both as a team member and as a software developer.<br><br></div>
